        <h2 class="about">About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a 3rd year Computer Science student and teaching assistant at
            the University of Toronto, Mississauga campus. My interest lies in
            computer systems, mainly processor architecture, operating systems,
            and parallel programming.
            <br/><br/>
            I am currently taking classes in software engineering and web
            programming, and I will be using this website to practice the things
            that I will be learning in both classes this semester. The website
            will look wonky, but please bear with me.
        </p>
