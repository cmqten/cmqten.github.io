            <h2 id="about_header" class="header">About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a 3rd year Computer Science student and teaching assistant
                at the University of Toronto, Mississauga campus. My interest
                lies in computer systems, mainly processor architecture,
                operating systems, and parallel programming.
                <br/><br/>
                I am currently taking classes in software engineering and web
                programming, and I will be using this website to practice the
                things that I will be learning in both classes this semester.
                The website will look wonky, but please bear with me.
